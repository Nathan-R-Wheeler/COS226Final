# COS226Final
This is the final project for my Data structures and Algorithms class. It uses B+ trees and A hash table, as well as mergesort to store bulk items.

<h1>How to Run:<br>
<br>
-When the program first runs, it prompts the user for what function they want the program to carry out:<br>
<br>
1: Create Index<br>
2: Exact value search<br>
3: Range Query<br>
4: Bye<br>
<br>

<h2>If the user selects 1: Create Index:<br>
<br>
-The program will prompt the user to select from a list of properties inside the database:
<br>
0: director<br>
1: genre<br>
2: id - Indexed<br>
3: minDuration<br>
4: movieName<br>
5: productionCompany<br>
6: quote<br>
7: rating<br>
8: releaseDate<br>
<br>
Upon selection the task will be carried out. <br>
<br>
Afterwards, user is returned to the properties menu.<br>
<br>
Upon another selection of property, the program will again 
prompt the user for the function to carry out upon the property.<br>
<br>


<h2>If the user selects 2: Exact Value Search:<br>
<br>
-The program will prompt the user with categories of searchable properties<br>
<br>
-After selecting which category to search, the program prompts the user what to search for<br>
<br>
-After sucessfully returning the searched item the program will prompt the user for what to do with the value.<br>
<br>
-The user can choose to either export it to a csv, or to delete it out of the database.
<br>

<h2>If the user selects 3: Range Query:<br>
<br>

<h2>If the user selects 4: Quit:<br>
<br>
-The program will close
